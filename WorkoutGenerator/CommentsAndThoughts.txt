Exercises are now filtered by user, next step is to make workouts specific to user.

At first, all I want to be able to do is have a database of exercises, add to them by category(legs, back,...), 
and be able to add
categories.  Then allow removal of category or exercise from database, exercise would be dependant on category.

Next I will want to be able to pull from that database a random list of exercises(one from each column)

Next pull random list(one from each column) but no repetition.

Next pull random list(one from each column) with no reptition because there is another database of used 
exercises that will have a time stamp and stay in that database for six days.


BaseController:  Inherit from a base controller that will have "
	    string user = User.Identity.Name;
            ApplicationUser userLoggedIn = context.Users.Single(c => c.UserName == user);"
*Will need to use sessions to work*


NEXT TODO:  Add ExerciseRecords, each exercise should have input for set, reps, and weight.
	needs to go into database according to id of exercise.
